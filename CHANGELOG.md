# Changelog

All notable changes to Markdown PR Comments for GitHub (formerly *Rich Diff Comments for GitHub*). Follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) loosely; versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.13.1] — 2026-10-09

### Fixed

- **On phones, the + button no longer sits on top of the text.** It stays in the left margin, next to the content, as on desktop.

## [1.13.0] — 2026-10-08

### Added

- **Works in Firefox (version 140 or newer)** with the same features as in Chrome and Edge.
- **Touch screens are supported, including Firefox for Android.** The + button is always visible, one tap starts a comment, dragging from one + to another selects a range, and the sidebar header can be dragged by touch.

## [1.12.0] — 2026-09-25

### Added

- **Every rendered comment now has a Copy Markdown action.** Copy the comment's original Markdown body from its header for reuse in another discussion or document.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-09-23

### Added

- **Commented table rows now show a persistent conversation marker.** The marker stays beside the exact row while full conversations remain below the table, shows how many threads belong to that row, and cycles through them when clicked or activated from the keyboard.
- **Commented lines inside fenced code blocks now show persistent conversation markers.** Each marker stays beside its affected line, displays the number of conversations there, and cycles through them by mouse or keyboard while the full threads remain below the code block.
- **Every rendered comment now has a Copy link action.** You can copy a direct link to your own comment or another reviewer's comment from its header, with immediate success or failure feedback.

### Fixed

- **The sidebar now offers “Render all Markdown files as rich-diff” only when another Markdown file still needs rendering.** When rendered files simply have no visible threads or changes, their empty states now say so without presenting a redundant action.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-09-23

### Changed

- **Authentication is now browser-session only.** The extension no longer offers its dormant Personal Access Token fallback, and upgrading to v1.10.0 removes any GitHub token previously saved by that older mode without reading or transmitting it. Normal commenting on public and private repositories continues to use the GitHub session already open in the browser.
- **Actions on your own comments are simpler and easier to find.** Edit and Delete now appear together in the comment header, with Delete clearly styled as destructive and still protected by confirmation. The redundant link back to the same comment on GitHub and its one-item overflow menu have been removed.

### Fixed

- **Table of Contents links work every time, including repeated clicks on the same section.** You can return to a section after scrolling away without first clicking a different heading, while links to other sections and browser Back/Forward navigation continue to work normally.
- **Sidebar lists now stay at the same scroll position while you resize the sidebar.** Dragging the bottom-right resize handle no longer makes the scrollbar thumb—and the visible place in Changes, Threads, or Outline—slide toward the bottom.
- **Large pull requests no longer offer a bulk-render action that GitHub cannot retain.** When GitHub optimizes a PR by unloading offscreen files, the sidebar now asks you to review Markdown files one at a time and switch each file to rich diff as needed, instead of showing temporary progress that disappears at the end.
- **The sidebar now returns when you open a pull request from the repository's Pull requests list.** Moving from the list into Files changed activates Changes, Threads, and Outline without requiring a page reload, including when you switch to a different pull request.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-07-02

### Added

- **GitHub's own file tree is now a live "you are here" indicator, in sync with the middle review area and the sidebar.** As you scroll between files, the matching row in GitHub's left-side file tree (and the "Jump to file" dropdown) picks up a subtle blue rail and background tint — matching how the sidebar's Outline pane already highlights the current heading. The highlight also updates instantly when you click a section in the Outline, a thread, or a change. Clicking anywhere on a tree row — the filename or its padding — now counts as a valid click, matching GitHub's own hit zone, so the sidebar reacts regardless of which pixel you hit.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-07-01

### Changed

- **Header icons in the sidebar now jump to the first change / thread in the file you're currently viewing** — instead of blindly advancing the global counter by one. On a multi-file PR this matches what you actually want: "I'm reading file X, take me to the first item in file X." If the current file has zero changes / threads (or you've scrolled somewhere with no rendered file in view), the icon falls back to the old "next in the PR" behaviour so it's never a dead click. The `[` / `]` and `j` / `k` keyboard shortcuts still walk globally — the icons just got a smarter default.
- **The sidebar now hides itself when you leave the Files-changed tab.** Clicking Conversation, Commits, or Checks (or navigating away from the PR entirely) makes the sidebar disappear immediately, so it no longer covers the PR title strip on Conversation. Coming back to Files-changed brings the sidebar back exactly where you left it — same position, same size, same collapsed state.
- **The Outline pane now follows your scrolling continuously and clearly highlights the current heading.** Previously the highlight was a faint tint that was easy to miss, and it could blink off entirely between two widely-spaced headings — you'd lose your place in a long document. Now the active row has a strong accent tint, a coloured rail on the left, bold text, stays on the last heading you scrolled past, and keeps itself centred inside the Outline list so it's visible even on long files.
- **Changes and Threads counters are now file-scoped, with a hint of the PR-wide total.** The number now reads as `3/8 (45)` — meaning "3rd of 8 changes in this file, 45 in the PR overall". Previously the same counter showed only `3/45`, which conflated "position in this file" with "position in the PR" and left you guessing how much of the current file was still to review. When you scroll into a file with no changes / threads of its own, the counter greys out to `0/0 (45)` so you immediately see "nothing to walk here". `[` / `]` and `j` / `k` still walk the whole PR — only the display changed.

### Added

- **Clicking a file in GitHub's own left-side file tree (or the "Jump to file" dropdown) now updates the sidebar's Changes, Threads, and Outline all at once — immediately, in step with GitHub's smooth-scroll.** Previously the sidebar only caught up after you started scrolling within the file, and for files without headings (a code-only `.md`, a whole-file NEW FILE card) it might not catch up at all. Any GitHub navigation surface that points at a specific file — the tree panel, the dropdown, the file-list overview — is covered.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Brand-new and deleted Markdown files now appear as a single summary card in the Changes pane.** Previously they were silently skipped (because flooding the pane with one entry per paragraph wasn't useful). Now you get one clearly-labelled card per whole-file change — green `+ NEW FILE · path/file.md` for added files, red `− DELETED · path/file.md` for deleted ones — with the file's first heading as a one-line preview. Click the card to jump straight to the file. Modified files still show per-block changes as before.

### Changed

- **Default sidebar position moved to the top-centre of the page**, sitting on the PR title line instead of the right edge. This keeps file contents below fully visible on first install — the previous right-dock layout could overlap diff content on narrower windows. Drag-and-drop still works; your custom position is remembered. Press `Shift+T` to snap back to the new default if you ever want to.
- **Speech-bubble icon redesigned to two solid filled bubbles** — cleaner, more legible, and no longer clipped at the right edge of the icon. It now reads as a discussion at a glance instead of an outlined sketch.
- **Page icon: cleaned up a stray pixel** on the left edge so the document outline now closes cleanly.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **The page icon and speech-bubble icon in the sidebar header are now one-click "go to next" shortcuts.** Click the page icon to jump to the next change; click the speech-bubble to jump to the next thread. The previous count between them tells you where you are at a glance (e.g. `3/12`). If nothing is currently in view, the click takes you to the first item — so opening a PR and tapping either icon lands you on the first change or thread.
- **`b` shortcut opens the Outline tab.** Tap `b` anywhere on a Files-changed page to expand the sidebar (if collapsed) and switch to Outline. If any Markdown files aren't rendered yet, they're rendered first so the outline has something to show.
- **Click a file in the Outline pane to jump Changes & Threads to that file.** Each file label in the Outline (the `../folder/file.md` headers) is now clickable — clicking jumps both the Changes and Threads counters to the first item in that file, so `[` / `]` and `j` / `k` continue navigation within that file. Useful when you've scrolled to a specific file and want the sidebar to follow.
- **Sidebar Changes & Threads auto-follow as you scroll between files.** When the file you're reading changes, the Changes and Threads counters automatically jump to that file's first item. Pair with `[` / `]` and `j` / `k` to keep navigating the file you just scrolled into.

### Changed

- **Cleaner, easier-to-scan sidebar header.** The diff and thread shortcuts now sit front-and-centre with sideways `<` / `>` arrows instead of stacked up / down ones, the count next to each is dimmed so the icons read first, and a thin separator keeps the two groups visually distinct. The book icon — previously "render all Markdown files" — is now the **Outline** button: click it to switch to the Outline tab (rendering any not-yet-rendered Markdown files along the way so the outline has headings to show).
- **Loading overlay text matches the toolbar.** While rendering Markdown files, the splash now reads "Rendering Markdown files as rich-diff" instead of the older "Loading Markdown files".

### Fixed

- **Changes pane now picks up more kinds of edits in modified files.** Newly added headings, paragraphs, list items, and tables that GitHub wraps in `<ins>` / `<del>` now show up as Changes entries — previously a whole replaced table or a brand-new heading appended to CHANGELOG.md was invisible in the Changes list.
- **Brand-new files no longer flood the Changes pane with one entry per paragraph.** When a PR adds a whole new Markdown file (e.g. a new README), the file's content stays visible in the rich-diff view and in the Outline tab, but it no longer dumps every heading and bullet into Changes — that "this file is new" signal is already in the diff header.
- **"Render all Markdown files as rich-diff" no longer skips files in the middle of long PRs.** Rewritten as a two-phase pass (mount-then-click) so even a PR with 8+ Markdown files reliably opens every one of them instead of stopping at the first few.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Comments on Markdown files that start with YAML frontmatter (the `---` ... `---` block at the top of design docs and dev plans) no longer land at the bottom of the file.** Headings, paragraphs, list items, and tables now anchor to their real source lines whether or not the file has frontmatter.

### Added

- **You can now leave inline `+` comments on YAML frontmatter rows.** Hover any row in the metadata block at the top of a file — `area:`, `status:`, `related:`, etc. — and click the `+` to comment on the metadata without flipping to source-diff.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Changes navigation — jump between added / removed / modified blocks without reading the kept prose around them.** A new **Changes** tab in the sidebar lists every changed paragraph, list item, table row, code block, heading, and blockquote in document order, with a kind glyph (`+` added / `−` removed / `±` mixed), a coloured left rail, a file:line label, and a snippet of the changed text. Click a card to jump; the target block briefly pulses so you see where you landed. The sidebar header also gets a `◀ N/M ▶` counter next to the existing thread `↑ ↓` (separated by a subtle divider so the two are clearly different concerns), and the same prev/next is bound to `[` and `]` (vim's `[c` / `]c` convention). The Changes tab and the header counter auto-hide when there's nothing to navigate (e.g. before any file is opened in rich-diff). This is the first thing reviewers reach for when opening a Markdown PR for the first time — scan the edits without re-reading the unchanged prose.
- **First / last change shortcuts: `Shift+[` (`{`) jumps to the first change, `Shift+]` (`}`) to the last.** Mirrors `h` / `l` for threads. Useful for jumping back to the top of a long PR after scrolling deep, or skipping straight to the final hunk to check the end-state.
- **Tab-switch shortcuts: press `1`, `2`, or `3`** to switch the sidebar to Changes, Threads, or Outline respectively. Auto-expands the sidebar if it was collapsed so you don't end up swapping a tab hidden behind the slim bar. Tab labels now carry tooltips (`Changes (1)`, `Threads (2)`, `Outline (3)`) so the shortcut is discoverable on hover.
- **"Render all Markdown files as rich-diff" CTA now also appears in the empty Changes pane** — previously the Changes tab was hidden whenever no file was rendered, so users on a fresh `/changes` page never saw it; now the tab stays visible with the same primary action button that the empty Threads pane has, so the next step is obvious from any tab.

### Changed

- **Renamed to "Markdown PR — Markdown PR Comments for GitHub"** (was *Markdown PR Comments for GitHub*). Same extension, same install — the new "Short — Long" pattern means narrow contexts like the browser toolbar tooltip and store carousel cards show a short `Markdown PR` prefix that fits, while wider contexts (toolbar hover, store detail page, screen readers) still show the full descriptive name. Auto-updates to the new display name with no action needed from you.

### Fixed

- **Thread navigation (`↑` / `↓` and the `N/M` counter) no longer accidentally walks the new Changes cards.** The thread-nav code was using an unscoped CSS selector (`.grdc-sidebar-card`) that matched both lists; on pages with few unresolved comments and several changes, pressing `↓` on the Threads tab would scroll to a *change* in the document instead of the next thread, and the counter showed inflated counts (e.g. `1/5` with only 1 thread visible). Pinned by a new regression test that scans `content.js` for any unscoped variant of the selector.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-05

### Changed

- **Editing your own comment is now one click.** A direct `Edit` link sits in the comment header next to `GitHub ↗`, so you no longer have to open the `⋯` menu first. `Delete` still lives in `⋯` (one extra click + a confirm prompt) because it's destructive.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-02

### Changed

- **The Outline tab now shows a folder hint next to each file label** so multiple files with the same name (e.g. several `README.md` or `SKILL.md`) are easy to tell apart at a glance. Deeply-nested files show their depth with one `../` per ancestor folder — e.g. `../../foo/README.md` for `features/sdk/foo/README.md`. Hover the label to see the full path.

### Fixed

- **Outline toolbar's `Fold H1` / `Fold H2` / `Fold H3` / `Expand all` (and the per-row outline chevrons) no longer silently do nothing until you refresh the page.** After GitHub re-rendered a file's rich-diff DOM in place (e.g. flipping between source and rendered, or React replacing nodes), the chevron buttons attached to each heading became stale, so clicking the Outline toolbar quietly no-op'd. Outline-pane clicks now lazily re-attach the in-heading chevron if it's missing, so the buttons stay self-healing without a page refresh.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-01

### Changed

- **Renamed to "Markdown PR Comments for GitHub"** (was *Rich Diff Comments for GitHub*). Same extension, same install — the new name makes it obvious at a glance what the extension is for. The display name updates in your browser's extensions list and toolbar tooltip after the auto-update lands; no action needed from you.
- **New icon to match the new name** — a bold "M↓" mark inside a speech bubble, in GitHub blue. Replaces the previous design so the toolbar icon, extensions list, and store listing all read as one consistent product.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **The threads sidebar is now always available on PR rich-diff pages.** It used to disappear whenever no file was opened in rich-diff (so landing on a fresh "Files changed" view in source-diff mode showed nothing), and on small READMEs with very little structure. The sidebar now shows on every PR Files-changed page so it's always findable — even before you open the first file as rich-diff.
- **"Render all Markdown files as rich-diff" in one click.** A new book icon in the sidebar header (and a big blue button in the empty Threads pane) opens every `.md` file in the PR as rich-diff at once. A brief "Loading Markdown files…" splash appears while it works; your scroll position is restored when it's done. Comments on the newly-opened files load automatically. Files that are already in rich-diff are left alone.
- **Keyboard shortcuts to show, hide, and reset the sidebar.** Press `t` anywhere on a Files-changed page to toggle the sidebar between collapsed and expanded — handy when you've collapsed it once and can't find the slim bar. Press `Shift+T` to reset the sidebar to its default right-edge spot at full size — recovers from cases where you dragged it on a wider window and reopened the page on a smaller one.
- **"Fold H1" button in the Outline toolbar.** Joins the existing `Fold H2` / `Fold H3` / `Expand all`. Collapses every top-level heading at once so each document shrinks to just its title — gives you a one-screen overview of which files changed on a multi-file PR.
- **Helpful empty state in the Threads pane.** When no comments are loaded yet (common when you've just opened the PR and haven't switched any files to rich-diff), the pane now shows a clear "Render all Markdown files as rich-diff" button instead of an empty list, so the next step is obvious.

### Changed

- **Sidebar header now matches GitHub's link blue** so it reads as part of GitHub's own UI rather than a custom accent. The collapsed bar is much easier to spot against any page background in both light and dark mode.
- **The "Unresolved only" funnel button is much easier to read on the new header** — pressed and unpressed states use a clear color inversion (white-on-blue when off, blue-on-white when on) so you can tell at a glance whether the filter is active.

### Fixed

- **The sidebar can no longer get stranded offscreen after a window resize.** If you dragged the sidebar on a larger window and then reopened the PR on a smaller one (or changed browser zoom), the sidebar sometimes ended up entirely outside the visible area — invisible. It now always stays at least partly in view, and your original drop position is remembered, so growing the window again slides it back to where you put it.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- **Inline comments on top-level list items now appear right under the item you commented on.** Before, leaving a comment on a top-level bullet in an added or deleted list could push the comment thread down below the entire list — so the comment looked like it belonged to the last item instead of the one you clicked. Comments now stay anchored to the correct bullet in every case.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-20

### Added

- **Threads sidebar.** A draggable, resizable panel docked to the right edge of the page that lists every review thread — with author, snippet, file:line, and resolved / outdated tags. Click a card to jump to the thread (the badge briefly flashes so you can see where you landed). The header has prev / next chevrons and a comment counter. Press `j` / `k` for next / previous thread, `h` / `l` for the first / last. A funnel icon toggles "Unresolved only" — visible while the sidebar is collapsed too, so you can filter without expanding. Collapse the sidebar to a slim bar; your collapsed state, filter, position, and size are remembered. Hidden automatically when the page has no threads, and also when you toggle to source-diff view (and back when you toggle to rich-diff).
- **Outline tab in the sidebar.** A second tab that shows the heading tree of every modified `.md` file in the PR, with a comment-count pill next to each section. Click a heading to jump to it; the current section is highlighted as you scroll. Per-row chevrons fold or expand individual sections. Toolbar buttons handle bulk folding: `Fold H2` / `Fold H3` (which flip to `Unfold` once everything's folded) and `Expand all`. Folding from the outline, the toolbar, or a heading's own chevron in the document all stay in sync.
- **Heading anchor links work in rich-diff.** Clicking a link like `[Change Log](#change-log)` from a Table of Contents now scrolls to the heading on rich-diff pages, just like it does on the rendered blob view.
- **Avatars and role badges in threads.** Every comment shows the author's avatar and matches GitHub's native source-diff badges: `Author` (the PR opener), plus `Owner` / `Member` / `Collaborator` / `Contributor` / `First-time contributor` / `First-timer` based on the commenter's relationship to the repo. Both can appear together (e.g. `Owner` `Author` when the repo owner opens their own PR).

### Changed

- **Comment badges are easier to spot.** The inline "💬 N comments" pill is larger, has a stronger blue accent stripe on the left, and a subtle shadow so it stands out from surrounding markdown while you're scrolling.
- **Comment badges show a disclosure chevron.** Each badge now starts with a chevron that points down when the thread is open and right when it's collapsed, so the open / closed state is visible at a glance. Clicking the badge still toggles the thread (no behavior change, just clearer affordance).
- **Cleaner thread look.** Threads use a pale-blue card on a white background to clearly mark the review surface, and replies inside a thread are tinted slightly deeper so you can see the nesting at a glance.
- **Better section-collapse affordance.** The fold chevron next to each heading now sits in a small left-side area instead of in front of the heading text, so headings no longer shift when the chevron appears.

### Fixed

- **Scroll position is preserved across re-renders.** After you reply, edit, delete, or resolve a comment, the page no longer jumps to the top — you stay anchored on the thread you were reading.
- **Deleted blocks no longer shift line numbers.** Comments on lines after a deleted block were sometimes off by one (per deleted block) because the deleted prose still appears in rich-diff. They're now correctly skipped, so line numbers stay accurate. Comments attached next to deleted blocks also no longer pick up strikethrough styling from the surrounding text.
- **Comment badges respect dark mode.** On pages where GitHub didn't fully define its theme tokens, the badge could appear with a bright light-mode background even when the rest of the page was dark. The badge now uses dark-mode-appropriate colors in that situation.
- **Section collapse stops at the right place.** Clicking the fold chevron next to a heading could collapse content past the next same-level heading when GitHub's rich-diff grouped hunks into sibling containers. The fold now correctly stops at the next heading at the same or shallower level.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-18

Initial release as an independent third-party extension.

### Features

- **Inline `+` button** on every commentable block in GitHub PR rich-diff view — paragraphs, headings (H1–H6), list items (including nested), table rows, and code blocks.
- **Click `+` → write a comment → post** as a real PR review comment on the correct source line. Works on public and private repos.
- **Drag `+` between blocks** to leave a multi-line range comment. The selected range tints yellow while dragging and stays highlighted for existing range threads.
- **Existing review threads render inline** as `💬 N comments` badges, anchored to the rendered block they belong to. Expand a thread to read replies, **reply**, **resolve / unresolve**, **edit your own comments**, or **delete your own comments** — all without leaving rich-diff.
- **Resolved / outdated thread state** is shown on the badge and dims the thread; resolving a thread auto-collapses its body, unresolving auto-expands.
- **GitHub-style comment box** with a Markdown toolbar, Write / Preview tabs (using GitHub's own renderer for full GFM), `@mention` autocomplete with full user list, and Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to submit.
- **Code-block features**: hover anywhere inside a `<pre>` and the `+` slides vertically to follow the cursor's line. The comment-box header shows the actual fence range (e.g. *"code block, lines 195–240"*).
- **Section collapse** by heading level — click the `▾` chevron next to any heading to fold that whole section. Useful for long design docs.
- **Source-diff sync** — after posting / replying / resolving / editing / deleting from rich-diff, toggling back to GitHub's source-diff view triggers a silent reload so source-diff comes back in sync.
- **No Personal Access Token required** — uses your existing GitHub session cookies. Works seamlessly on public and private repos.
