# Markdown PR Comments for GitHub and Azure DevOps

Two separate Chrome/Edge extensions that let you leave **and view** inline pull-request review comments directly in rendered Markdown:

- **Markdown PR — Markdown PR Comments for GitHub** targets GitHub rich diff.
- **Markdown PR — Azure DevOps PR Comments** targets Azure DevOps Preview mode.

Install only the target you use; each package requests access solely to its own service.

## Credits

Original project: **Markdown PR Comments** by Chien Yuan Chang — <https://github.com/chienyuanchang/rich-diff-comments> (MIT).
This fork ([raedkit/rich-diff-comments-firefox](https://github.com/raedkit/rich-diff-comments-firefox)) adds a Firefox build for personal use; all original features and design are the upstream author's work.

## Problem

GitHub rich diff and Azure DevOps Preview render Markdown beautifully, but neither provides the complete block-level review workflow available in source diff. Reviewers otherwise switch views repeatedly to comment, find conversations, and scan what changed.

## What this does

### Common features

- Overlays a `+` button on every paragraph, heading, list item, table row, and code block in the rendered Markdown review surface.
- Click `+` → write a comment → posts as a real PR review comment on the correct source line.
- Renders existing review threads inline at the rendered block that corresponds to each commented line.
- **Reply** to threads, **resolve / unresolve** them, and **edit / delete** your own comments from the rendered view.
- **Mention teammates:** type `@` in a comment, reply, or edit to search host-supported people and preserve native notifications.
- **Commented table rows and fenced-code lines stay identifiable:** persistent markers show conversation counts and cycle through threads by mouse or keyboard.
- **Copy a direct link** to any visible review comment from its header.
- **Threads sidebar** docked to the right edge lists every review thread (author, snippet, file:line, and target-supported status tags) — click to jump, with prev/next chevrons and a comment counter.
- **Outline tab** in the sidebar shows the heading tree of every changed `.md` file with comment-count pills, per-section folding, and bulk `Fold H1 / H2 / H3` / `Expand all` controls.
- **Changes tab** in the sidebar lists every changed block (paragraph / list item / table row / code block / heading / blockquote) with a `+` / `−` / `±` kind glyph, file:line, and a snippet. The header also gets a `◀ N/M ▶` counter so you can step through changes without opening the tab. Best way to scan a Markdown PR for the first time without re-reading the unchanged prose.
- **Native file navigation stays synchronized:** clicking a file in either host's file tree updates the rendered review surface and the extension's Changes, Threads, and Outline context; extension navigation selects the corresponding native file.
- **Copy Markdown:** copy a rendered comment's original Markdown body for reuse in another discussion or document.
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** `j` / `k` next / previous thread, `h` / `l` first / last thread, `[` / `]` previous / next change, `{` / `}` (Shift+[, Shift+]) first / last change, `1` / `2` / `3` switch sidebar tab (Changes / Threads / Outline), `t` toggle the sidebar, `Shift+T` reset its position.
- No PAT required — each target uses the existing signed-in session for its service.

### GitHub-specific features

- **Start rendered review across the pull request:** render every changed Markdown file as rich diff in one sweep when GitHub's PR mode can retain them; optimized large PRs receive one-file-at-a-time guidance.
- **Rich-diff integration:** preserve GitHub's added/removed rendering, expose outdated-thread state and author-association badges, and keep heading anchor links working in rendered Markdown.

### Azure DevOps-specific features

- **Open Markdown Preview in one click:** select the current or first changed Markdown file and retain Preview mode while moving between files.
- **Preview change highlighting:** added sections are green, modified sections use a warm warning highlight, and new files receive a subtle marker.
- **PR-wide source analysis before Preview visits:** build Changes and Outline from pull-request source data before every Markdown file has been opened in Preview.

See the shared [feature parity roadmap](docs/FEATURES.md) for both targets and the small [GitHub](docs/github/FEATURES.md) / [Azure DevOps](docs/ado/FEATURES.md) platform notes for host-specific behavior.

No separate login, setup, or Personal Access Token is required. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for both walkthroughs.

> 📌 **Just installed?** Hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) any GitHub or Azure DevOps PR tab that was already open when you installed — see [INSTALL.md → Just installed?](INSTALL.md#just-installed).

### For local development

1. `git clone https://github.com/chienyuanchang/rich-diff-comments`
2. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/` (or Edge → `edge://extensions/`)
3. Enable **Developer mode**
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select one target folder:
  - **GitHub:** `extensions/github/`
  - **Azure DevOps:** `extensions/ado/`
5. Open a pull request's changed-files view. Select rich diff for a GitHub Markdown file, or use the Azure DevOps sidebar's **Open Markdown Preview** action.

After editing a target's content script, click the reload icon on the extension card and hard-refresh the PR (Ctrl+Shift+R). If you edit anything under `src/lib/`, run `.\scripts\dev-sync.ps1 -Target github` or `-Target ado` first, then reload that extension.

## Usage

1. Open a PR's changed-files view
2. Select **rich diff** for a GitHub Markdown file, or click **Open Markdown Preview** in the Azure DevOps sidebar
3. Hover a block → click the `+` button → type → **Comment**
4. Existing comments appear inline as a `💬 N comments` badge — click to expand

## Tests

All suites are local — no live GitHub or Azure DevOps calls.

```bash
npm install         # one-time: fetches jsdom + @playwright/test (devDeps only)
npx playwright install chromium    # one-time: ~150 MB Chromium for e2e tests

npm test                  # 410 unit/static tests (Node:test + jsdom)
npm run test:e2e          # 21 GitHub Playwright fixtures
npm run test:e2e:ado      # 63 ADO Preview + mocked REST Playwright fixtures
npm run test:e2e:all      # both browser targets
npm run test:all          # Node tests plus both browser targets
```

**Unit tests** (`tests/*.test.js`) cover the pure helpers (line matching, response parsing, table arithmetic, code-block fence detection, anchor-key encoding) and DOM-coupled glue (per-file block→line mapping, `+`-button anchor selection, `styles.css` coverage).

**GitHub E2E tests** (`tests/e2e/*.spec.js`) drive the GitHub extension against captured rich-diff HTML fixtures. **ADO E2E tests** (`tests/e2e-ado/*.spec.js`) drive the separate ADO manifest against Preview-shaped fixtures and a stateful mocked ADO REST API. Both cover what jsdom cannot: real CSS layout, `:hover`, keyboard events, scrolling, and SPA timing.

The extension itself ships zero runtime npm dependencies — `jsdom` and `@playwright/test` are devDependencies only. The published zip contains no `node_modules`, no `package.json`, no test files.

GitHub network mutations remain covered by the [manual test checklist](docs/github/DEV_NOTES.md#manual-test-checklist). The ADO fixture suite covers create, reply, status, edit, and delete requests without contacting a live organization.

## Packaging a release

Build a publish-ready zip for the Chrome Web Store / Edge Add-ons:

```powershell
# From this folder
.\scripts\package.ps1
.\scripts\package.ps1 -Target ado
# → rdc-<version>.zip for GitHub; rdc-ado-<version>.zip for ADO
```

See [docs/PUBLISHING.md](docs/PUBLISHING.md) for the full publishing workflow (store submission, listing copy, permissions justification, versioning).

For a guided pre-submission audit + per-version release-doc generation, the [`rdc-publish-check`](.github/skills/rdc-publish-check/SKILL.md) skill automates the workflow.

## Limitations

- Mermaid diagrams and other non-text blocks can't be matched against source — comments near them may anchor to the previous matched block.
- Requires rendered Markdown to be active for the file (GitHub rich diff or Azure DevOps Preview).
- Service APIs may reject comments on source lines that are not reviewable in the current pull-request iteration.
