description: Iterative feature-development loop for the GitHub and Azure DevOps Markdown PR Comments browser extensions. Use when starting a new feature or bug fix — defines one shared outcome and both target statuses in FEATURES.md, records only necessary target differences, then builds, tests, and updates docs.

# Feature development loop

This skill captures how a feature or bug fix moves from "noticed it" to "shipped and documented" across the GitHub and Azure DevOps targets. The loop is shaped by browser-extension DOM dependencies: pure behavior is shared and unit-tested, while each host surface also needs fixture and manual validation.

## When to use

- The user says "let's work on X", "fix this", "add this feature", "implement Y" referring to anything in [docs/FEATURES.md](../../../docs/FEATURES.md).
- The user reports a bug during manual testing of the extension.
- The user asks "what should we do next?" while planning.
- A new idea comes up during a chat that should be captured before being built.

## When NOT to use

- Pure documentation edits with no code change (use direct file edits).
- Publishing / release work — use [rdc-publish-check](../rdc-publish-check/SKILL.md) instead.
- One-off questions about a host's internals — answer directly and add a target developer note only if the finding will be useful again.

## Documentation model

Keep roadmap status, target constraints, durable decisions, and captured implementation evidence in their designated sources.

| File | Purpose | What goes here |
|---|---|---|
| [docs/FEATURES.md](../../../docs/FEATURES.md) | **The authoritative parity roadmap.** | Define the shared user outcome once, assign P0–P3 priority, and record GitHub and ADO status independently. |
| [docs/github/FEATURES.md](../../../docs/github/FEATURES.md) / [docs/ado/FEATURES.md](../../../docs/ado/FEATURES.md) | **Target notes, not additional roadmaps.** | Record only host-specific mechanics, constraints, acceptance differences, and intentional delegation. Never duplicate priority or status. |
| [docs/github/APPROACH.md](../../../docs/github/APPROACH.md) | **The GitHub knowledge base.** Stable architectural decisions and matching strategies. | Why we use forward-scan matching, how the source-to-rendered mapping works, the LEFT vs RIGHT side model — durable concepts that outlive any single feature. |
| [docs/github/DEV_NOTES.md](../../../docs/github/DEV_NOTES.md) / [docs/ado/ADO_DEV_NOTES.md](../../../docs/ado/ADO_DEV_NOTES.md) | **Target implementation diaries.** | Reverse-engineered payloads, DOM quirks, captured network calls, debugging recipes, and evidence future work will need. |

> **Rule of thumb:** if it's a *what* (shared outcome, priority, status) → main FEATURES. If it's a host-specific product constraint → target FEATURES. If it's a *why* that should outlive a feature → APPROACH. If it's observed *how* (endpoint, DOM, payload, probe) → the target DEV_NOTES.

## The eight-step loop

### Step 1 — Identify the next feature or bug

Sources, in rough order of frequency:

1. **Manual testing of the extension** — find something annoying or broken.
2. **Feedback from others** — paste of a screenshot, a complaint about UX, a comment that the docs are confusing.
3. **The shared FEATURES.md backlog** — items already triaged with visible target gaps.

The skill agent should identify the affected target or shared helper and check the main roadmap to avoid duplicating an outcome.

### Step 2 — Write the solution into FEATURES.md, then discuss

Before any code:

1. Add or update one shared-outcome entry in the main [docs/FEATURES.md](../../../docs/FEATURES.md), which is the only feature status source.
2. Record GitHub and ADO status separately, including `N/A`, native-equivalent, or blocked when exact parity is impossible.
3. Include shared acceptance criteria, deferred follow-ups, and risk acceptances. If the outcome is host-specific, keep it in the main roadmap and mark the other target native-equivalent or not applicable rather than creating a second status entry.
4. Put host-specific mechanics in the matching target FEATURES page only when they materially differ; do not repeat priority, status, or version there.
5. Cross-reference the target DEV_NOTES / APPROACH when relevant background already exists.
6. Stop and discuss with the user. Confirm scope and call out unknowns explicitly. **If a reverse-engineered payload is needed, block on capturing it before writing code** — see the target DEV_NOTES for examples.

This step is gated. Do not skip ahead to coding without confirmation.

### Step 3 — Build

Implement against the agreed plan. Conventions:

- **DOM-bound code** lives in the affected target's `content.js`.
- **Pure helpers** (no DOM, no fetch) go in `src/lib/<area>.js` so they're testable in Node — see existing `textMatch.js`, `codeBlocks.js`, `sidebar.js`, `anchors.js`.
- **Defensive against null / unexpected input** for any helper that might receive user content or host data.
- **Comment generously** on non-obvious decisions, especially anything that interacts with undocumented host behavior.
- **Diagnostic logs** use `[GRDC]` for GitHub and `[ADRC]` for ADO.

### Step 4 — Manual test (human-only)

The user runs the affected target in a real PR. The skill agent's role here is to be ready for the next round — don't move on until the user reports back.

### Step 5 — Triage surprises

When the manual test surfaces a bug, the user investigates console logs, network traffic, DOM state, and the host's native review behavior. They share findings, often as a screenshot, DOM snippet, or payload.

**Ask for the actual DOM / payload, not a description.** A captured `<li class="removed grdc-hoverable">…</li>` snippet immediately reveals that GitHub uses a class, not a `<del>` wrapper. A described "the deleted lines look weird" leaves us guessing.

### Step 6 — Fix, iterate

The agent fixes based on the captured evidence. Usually takes 1–3 rounds — each round is steps 3→5 in miniature. Keep changes minimal per round so each fix is independently verifiable.

### Step 7 — Refactor, test, clean up

When the feature is working, before declaring done:

1. **Identify pure logic** that was inlined in `content.js`. If it has clear inputs/outputs and no DOM/fetch, lift it to `src/lib/<area>.js`.
2. **Add unit tests** in `tests/<area>.test.js` using Node's built-in `node:test`. Cover happy paths, boundaries, defensive null/invalid input. Aim for 5–15 tests per helper.
3. **Register new lib files** in every target manifest that consumes them. Run `npm run sync -- --target github` and/or `--target ado` so the browser dev-load folders receive the shared source. (`npm run package` and `npm run preflight` synchronize automatically.)
4. **Re-run all tests:** `npm test` should be 100% green.
5. **Re-run manual tests** against the affected target's developer notes and release checklist.

The goal isn't 100% coverage — it's "every algorithm a future change might break has a regression test."

### Step 8 — Update the documentation sources

After the feature ships:

- [docs/FEATURES.md](../../../docs/FEATURES.md):
  - Update only the shipped target's status and target-qualified version.
  - Condense the shared entry to the final user outcome; leave the other target visibly planned, partial, blocked, native-equivalent, or not applicable.
  - Update a target FEATURES page only if its mechanics, constraints, or intentional differences changed.
- [docs/github/APPROACH.md](../../../docs/github/APPROACH.md):
  - Only if a *durable* architectural concept changed. New feature additions rarely belong here.
- [docs/github/DEV_NOTES.md](../../../docs/github/DEV_NOTES.md) or [docs/ado/ADO_DEV_NOTES.md](../../../docs/ado/ADO_DEV_NOTES.md):
  - Add newly captured payloads, DOM discoveries, or "I thought X but actually Y" entries to the affected target only.
- [CHANGELOG.md](../../../CHANGELOG.md) or [CHANGELOG_ADO.md](../../../CHANGELOG_ADO.md):
  - Append to `[Unreleased]` under `### Added` / `### Fixed`.
  - **User-facing language only.** Write each bullet like a feature announcement to someone who has never opened the source. No file/function/class names, no CSS selectors, no DOM-shape detail, no specific line numbers from a bug repro file. Stick to *what the user sees, when they'd notice it, why it's better.* Full rules and examples in [rdc-publish-check → CHANGELOG / release-notes writing rules](../rdc-publish-check/SKILL.md#changelog--release-notes-writing-rules).

Then commit, push, and the user moves to the next iteration.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **Writing code before FEATURES.md defines the shared outcome and target status.** Even a quick fix benefits from a one-line item: it forces explicit scope and makes parity drift visible.
- **Guessing at host endpoint payloads.** A `200 OK` doesn't prove the stored semantics are correct—capture the real native request and validate the resulting thread.
- **Skipping the refactor step.** Inline ad-hoc functions in `content.js` accumulate fast and become untestable. Move pure logic out *the same session* it's written.
- **Marking one target "shipped" by rewriting the feature as target-specific.** Update that target's status cell and leave the other target's gap explicit.
- **Touching the `content-understanding/tools/github-rich-diff-comments/` mirror.** That's a snapshot in another repo, not the source of truth. All work goes in `c:\Local\local_repos\rich-diff-comments\`.

## Reference: pure-helper library structure

When extracting logic, follow the existing pattern (see [src/lib/sidebar.js](../../../src/lib/sidebar.js)):

```js
(function (root, factory) {
  'use strict';
  const api = factory();
  if (typeof module === 'object' && module && module.exports) {
    module.exports = api;
  } else {
    root.GRDC = root.GRDC || {};
    Object.assign(root.GRDC, api);
  }
})(typeof self !== 'undefined' ? self : globalThis, function () {
  'use strict';

  function helper(x) { /* ... */ }

  return { helper };
});
```

This dual-context export lets the same file work in:

- The browser content script (registered in `manifest.json`, attaches to `window.GRDC`).
- Node tests (`require('../src/lib/...')`).

Tests follow [tests/sidebar.test.js](../../../tests/sidebar.test.js) — Node's `node:test` + `node:assert/strict`, no external deps.
