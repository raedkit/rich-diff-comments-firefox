Azure DevOps Preview makes Markdown design documents, plans, READMEs, and ADRs easy to read—but reviewing them still means switching back to source diff to find the right line and conversation. This extension turns Preview into a complete rendered-document review surface.

What it does:

• Start from any pull request Files page: the sidebar appears immediately and can open an available changed Markdown file in Preview for you.
• Hover a paragraph, heading, list item, table row, or code block and click the blue “+” to create a real Azure DevOps pull request comment on the matching source line.
• Drag between rendered blocks to comment on a multi-line range. Inside fenced code, move the “+” to target an individual source line.
• See existing review conversations beside the rendered section they belong to. Expand a thread to reply, resolve or reopen it, and edit or delete your own comments.
• Copy a direct link to any visible comment or copy its original Markdown for reuse elsewhere.
• Persistent markers identify table rows and fenced-code lines with existing conversations. A count appears when several threads share a row or line, and activating the marker cycles through them.
• Write in Markdown with formatting controls, Write/Preview tabs, automatic textarea growth, and Cmd/Ctrl+Enter submission.
• Type @ in a comment, reply, or edit to search for teammates and insert a native Azure DevOps mention. Mentioned names remain readable in inline conversations and the Threads sidebar.
• Changes tab: scan changed Markdown sections across every file in the pull request. New, deleted, and renamed files receive clear summaries; click a card or use keyboard shortcuts to navigate while remaining in Preview.
• Added and modified sections are highlighted directly in Preview, while completely new files receive a subtle NEW FILE marker.
• Threads tab: see all review threads in stable Azure DevOps file-tree order, filter to unresolved conversations, and jump directly to a thread in another file.
• Outline tab: browse headings from every changed Markdown file, see section thread counts, jump across files, fold individual sections, or bulk-fold H1/H2/H3 sections.
• Header icons jump to the first change or thread in the current file. Counters such as “2/4 (11)” show current-file progress and the pull-request total.
• Keyboard workflow: 1/2/3 switch tabs; b opens Outline; t toggles the sidebar; Shift+T resets it; j/k/h/l navigate threads; [ ] { } navigate changes.
• The interface follows Azure DevOps light, dark, and Windows high-contrast themes without closing drafts or resetting navigation.

No Personal Access Token or separate setup is required. Requests use the Azure DevOps session already open in your browser and go only to the current dev.azure.com or legacy visualstudio.com organization. No third-party servers, telemetry, analytics, ads, or remote code.

## Privacy & permissions

### Single purpose description

```
Add inline review comments and document navigation to rendered Markdown in Azure DevOps pull request Preview mode, so reviewers can comment, manage threads, scan changes, and navigate headings without switching back to source diff.
```

### Permission justification

This extension declares **no** entries in `permissions`. There are no Edge extension API permissions to justify.

### Host permission justification (under 1,000 characters)

```
“https://dev.azure.com/*” covers current Azure DevOps organization URLs and “https://*.visualstudio.com/*” covers legacy Azure DevOps URLs. Access is required to read rendered Markdown Preview content, inject the review interface, and make same-origin requests using the browser-managed Azure DevOps session. Those requests fetch pull request metadata, Markdown source, changed files, review threads and identity data, and create/reply/edit/delete comments or change thread status only when the user requests it. No other host is accessed. No data is sent to third parties, and there is no analytics or telemetry.

### Data usage

Select only:

- ☑ **Authentication information** — relies on the browser-managed Azure DevOps session; never reads or stores passwords, raw session cookies, PATs, or OAuth tokens.
- ☑ **Website content** — processes rendered Markdown, Markdown source, pull request metadata, changed-file information, review threads, and comments solely for the rendered review interface.
- ☑ **Personally identifiable information** — when the user invokes `@mention` autocomplete, the extension processes Azure DevOps identity search results such as display names and sign-in addresses solely to show matching teammates and submit the selected native mention.

Leave all other categories unchecked. Confirm that data is not sold, is not used outside the extension's purpose, and is not used for credit or lending decisions.

### Remote code

**Answer:** No.

All JavaScript is bundled in the package. There is no `eval`, dynamically downloaded executable code, remotely hosted script, WebAssembly download, or external runtime dependency. Azure DevOps responses are processed only as data.

## Notes for certification (under 2,000 characters)

```
This extension activates only on Azure DevOps pull request URLs under dev.azure.com or legacy *.visualstudio.com origins. It enhances Preview mode for changed Markdown files.

TEST PAGE
https://dev.azure.com/chienyuanchang/test-ado-md-comments/_git/test-ado-md-comments/pullrequest/1?_a=files

HOW TO TEST
1. Sign in to Azure DevOps and open the test pull request (or any accessible PR that changes a .md file).
2. Select Files while no Markdown Preview is open. The sidebar should appear immediately; choose Open Markdown Preview and confirm that it opens an available changed Markdown file in Preview.
3. Hover a paragraph or heading. A blue “+” appears. Clicking it opens the Markdown comment editor. Posting requires normal comment permission; read-only navigation works without write permission.
4. In the editor, type `@` followed by at least two characters (spaces are supported). Select a person and confirm the posted conversation shows the readable name.
5. Existing conversations appear beside rendered content. Use Copy link on any visible comment and confirm the destination reaches that comment; use Copy Markdown and confirm the original Markdown reaches the clipboard. Table rows and fenced-code lines with conversations show persistent markers; activate a marker to open its thread. The sidebar contains Changes, Threads, and Outline tabs.
6. Cards and headings navigate between Markdown files while retaining Preview. Use 1/2/3 to switch tabs, j/k for threads, [ and ] for changes, and t to collapse/expand the sidebar.
7. Change the Azure DevOps light/dark theme; the interface updates without remounting or losing a draft.

AUTHENTICATION
No credentials are bundled or requested. Same-origin requests use the reviewer's existing browser-managed Azure DevOps session.

DEPENDENCIES
None. No backend, analytics, telemetry, remote code, or third-party service.
