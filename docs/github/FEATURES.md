# GitHub feature notes

This document records GitHub-specific behavior and constraints for the shared product roadmap in [Features & parity roadmap](../FEATURES.md). It is **not a second roadmap**: priorities and GitHub/ADO status are updated only in the shared document.

For durable GitHub architecture decisions, see [Approach](./APPROACH.md). For endpoint payloads, DOM findings, debugging recipes, and manual checks, see [GitHub developer notes](./DEV_NOTES.md). The implemented sidebar-header design is preserved in the [GitHub sidebar header v2 record](./SIDEBAR_HEADER_V2.md).

## Surface mapping

| Shared capability | GitHub implementation |
|---|---|
| Rendered review surface | GitHub's per-file rich-diff view on a pull request's Files changed page. |
| Activate rendered review | Each Markdown file has its own source/rendered toggle. The extension's render-all action opens every changed Markdown file in one pass. |
| Create and manage threads | Same-origin GitHub page-data endpoints use the existing signed-in session. |
| Comment preview | GitHub's server renderer provides full GitHub Flavored Markdown; the bundled renderer is a fallback. |
| Changes | Native rich-diff added/removed markers identify changed rendered blocks. New and deleted files receive summary cards. |
| Cross-file navigation | File-tree anchors, rendered file containers, and scroll position keep Changes, Threads, and Outline synchronized. |
| Lifecycle | Mutation and route observation rebuild the review surface as GitHub replaces rich-diff DOM or moves between pull requests. |
| Theme | Primer variables and defensive light/dark fallbacks match the active GitHub theme. |

## Current platform advantages

- `@mention` autocomplete uses GitHub collaborator suggestions and is pre-warmed during initialization.
- Comment bodies and previews can use GitHub's own renderer.
- GitHub exposes author-association and outdated-thread information, so the extension can show role badges and outdated state.
- Rich diff already marks additions and removals, so the extension does not need to calculate the document diff itself.

## Current platform constraints

- Comment actions differ in scope. Edit and Delete apply only to the reviewer's own comments, while Copy link and Copy Markdown work for every visible comment. Copy Markdown uses the stored raw body without generated attribution or links. GitHub's native menu also offers Quote reply, Reference in a new issue, and permission-gated Hide. Keep issue creation exploratory until there is evidence of demand, and keep Hide delegated to GitHub rather than reproducing moderation permissions and reason selection.
- Rich diff is enabled separately for each Markdown file, which is why GitHub needs the render-all action. Azure DevOps Preview is PR-wide and sticky instead.
- Outline bulk controls currently apply Fold H1/H2/H3 and Expand all across every rendered Markdown file in the pull request. This is useful for PR-wide triage but broader than ADO's current-file behavior; labels do not yet make that scope explicit.
- A future Threads-toolbar **Collapse all conversations** / **Expand all conversations** action should affect conversation bodies across every currently rendered Markdown file. Badges and table/code markers remain visible so comments stay discoverable.
- The sidebar can collapse to its header and can be toggled with the keyboard, but unlike ADO it has no × control that fully hides it and no compact launcher for restoring it.
- Deleted prose appears in rich diff, but posting on it requires LEFT-side source mapping and payloads. That remains tracked in the shared roadmap.
- Valid HTML and syntax-highlighting constraints keep table-row and code-line thread bodies below the containing table or code block. Persistent keyboard-accessible markers now provide the in-place signal, show conversation counts, and cycle through threads without altering table or highlighted-code markup.
- Changes navigation currently covers rendered Markdown only. Extending it to source-diff hunks for other file types remains shared roadmap work.

## Open GitHub design notes

### Current-file focus

A 2026-07 attempt rebuilt filtered Changes and Threads panes whenever the viewport crossed a file boundary. It was reverted because transient blank file detection, click-navigation pinning, and rebuilt flat indexes could leave the pane empty or one file behind.

A retry should keep navigation state independent from presentation. Prefer collapsible file groups or CSS-only visibility over rebuilding lists during scroll, retain the last known valid file, and restore selection by stable card key rather than array index.

### Native comment form cloning

The extension deliberately builds its own editor. GitHub's native form is mounted by Primer React; cloning its DOM produces buttons and tabs without their React state, event handlers, upload context, or current hidden inputs. Reusing GitHub's rendering and suggestion endpoints is stable enough; coupling to private React fibers is not.

### Activation after installation

Chromium does not inject a newly installed content script into an already-open pull-request tab. Documentation currently tells users to refresh. Firefox source suggests it injects into already-open tabs when an add-on is installed or enabled, but this has not been verified in a running Firefox (see [developer notes](./DEV_NOTES.md#firefox)). A toolbar-badge prototype was rejected because new extension icons are usually hidden behind the extensions menu. An in-page prompt would require broader permissions and should be reconsidered only if user feedback shows the documentation is insufficient.

## GitHub-specific delegation

The extension continues to delegate these capabilities to GitHub's native Files changed interface:

- Submit, approve, or request changes for a complete review.
- Mark a file as viewed.
- Navigate the pull request's complete file tree.
- Work in source diff, where GitHub already supplies line-comment controls.
- Upload images through GitHub's native editor.
